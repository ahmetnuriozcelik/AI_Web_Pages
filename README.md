# WordPress Integration Page Generator ✅ TESTED & WORKING

Automatically generate customized WordPress integration pages using Claude AI for content generation.

## Overview

This Python script automates the creation of WordPress integration landing pages by:
1. Reading integration data from a CSV file
2. Using Claude AI to generate professional benefit descriptions based on benefit titles
3. Replacing template variables with AI-generated content
4. Creating draft pages in WordPress via REST API

## Successfully Tested

✅ Generated 3 integration pages (ADP Workforce Now, Workday, BambooHR)
✅ Claude API content generation working
✅ WordPress REST API draft page creation working
✅ Template variable replacement working

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- WordPress site with REST API enabled
- WordPress Application Password (not your regular password)
- Anthropic API key

## Installation

### 1. Clone or download this project

```bash
cd /Users/ahmetnuriozcelik/Documents/AI_Web_Pages
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### 1. Create WordPress Application Password

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Go to **Users** → **Profile**
3. Scroll down to **Application Passwords**
4. Enter a name (e.g., "AI Page Generator")
5. Click **Add New Application Password**
6. Copy the generated password (it will look like: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)

### 2. Find your Template Page ID

1. Go to **Pages** in WordPress admin
2. Hover over your template page
3. Look at the URL in your browser's status bar
4. The ID is the number after `post=` (e.g., `post=123` means ID is `123`)

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
WORDPRESS_SITE_URL=https://yoursite.com
WORDPRESS_USERNAME=your_username
WORDPRESS_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-api-key-here
```

**Important:** 
- Use your Application Password, NOT your regular WordPress password
- Keep spaces in the Application Password as generated
- Use the full site URL including `https://` (no trailing slash)
- The script uses `WORDPRESS_SITE_URL` not `WORDPRESS_URL`

## Template Page Setup

Create a WordPress page with the following placeholders:

```html
<!-- Hero Section -->
<h1>{{HEADLINE}}</h1>
<h2>{{SUBHEADLINE}}</h2>
<img src="{{HERO_IMAGE}}" alt="Hero Image">

<!-- Features Section -->
<div class="features">
  <div class="feature">
    <h3>{{FEATURE_1_TITLE}}</h3>
    <p>{{FEATURE_1_DESC}}</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h3>{{FEATURE_2_TITLE}}</h3>
    <p>{{FEATURE_2_DESC}}</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- CTA Section -->
<button>Connect Bucketlist with {{INTEGRATION_NAME}}</button>
```

## CSV File Format

Your `integrations.csv` should have these columns:

```csv
Partner,Partner_subtitle,Benefit_1_title,Benefit_2_title,Benefit_3_title
ADP Workforce Now,Sync ADP Workforce Now with Bucketlist to automate workflows and reduce admin tasks.,Data management,Time savings,Data-driven recognition
Workday,Connect Workday with Bucketlist to streamline employee recognition and engagement.,Seamless sync,Enhanced accuracy,Recognition automation
```

**Columns:**
- **Partner**: Name of the integration (e.g., "ADP Workforce Now")
- **Partner_subtitle**: One sentence describing the main benefit
- **Benefit_1_title**: First benefit title (short phrase)
- **Benefit_2_title**: Second benefit title (short phrase)
- **Benefit_3_title**: Third benefit title (short phrase)

**Note:** Benefit descriptions are automatically generated by Claude - you only provide titles!

## Usage

### Run the script

**Create WordPress pages:**
```bash
python3 generate_integration_pages.py integrations.csv template.html
```

**Preview mode (test without creating pages):**
```bash
python3 generate_integration_pages.py integrations.csv template.html --preview
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

- Ensure you're using an **Application Password**, not your regular password
- Check that your username is correct
- Verify the WordPress REST API is enabled on your site

### Template Page Not Found

- Double-check the page ID in your `.env` file
- Ensure the page exists and isn't in the trash

### Claude API Errors

- Verify your Anthropic API key is correct
- Check you have sufficient API credits
- Ensure you have access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet

### CSV Reading Errors

- Check that `integrations.csv` exists in the same directory
- Ensure the CSV has the correct column headers
- Verify the file encoding is UTF-8

## Customization

### Modify the Content Prompt

Edit the `generate_content` method in `generate_pages.py` to customize what Claude generates.

### Add More Placeholders

1. Add placeholders to your WordPress template (e.g., `{{NEW_FIELD}}`)
2. Update the Claude prompt to generate that field
3. Add the replacement in the `replace_placeholders` function

### Change Page Status

By default, pages are created as drafts. To publish immediately:

```python
page = wp_client.create_page(
    title=page_title,
    content=page_content,
    slug=integration['slug'],
    status='publish'  # Change from 'draft' to 'publish'
)
```
