## Workflow

3. Script reads CSV
4. For each integration:
   - Calls Claude API 3 times (once per benefit)
   - Generates professional descriptions
   - Replaces template variables
   - Creates WordPress draft via REST API
5. Review drafts in WordPress admin
6. Publish when ready

---

## Files

- `generate_integration_pages.py` - Main script
- `template.html` - HTML template with variables
- `integrations.csv` - Your integration data
- `.env` - Your credentials (not in git)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

---

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "WordPress credentials not configured"**
- Check `.env` file exists
- Verify variable name is `WORDPRESS_SITE_URL` not `WORDPRESS_URL`
- Ensure Application Password is correct

**Error: Claude API errors**
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Check API credits at console.anthropic.com

**Deprecation warning about model**
- Safe to ignore - model works fine
- Warning just means model will be updated in future

---

## Cost Estimate

Per integration page:
- 3 Claude API calls (~300 tokens total)
- Cost: ~$0.01 per integration at current rates
- 100 integration pages ≈ $1.00

---

## Next Steps

1. Add more integrations to CSV
2. Customize `template.html` with your design
3. Run batch generation
4. Review and publish in WordPress

All pages are created as **drafts** for your review before publishing.
